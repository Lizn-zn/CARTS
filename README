A novel approach for neural theorem proving that combines diversified tactic calibration with bias-resistant tree search. Published at ICLR 2025.

## Overview

This repository implements CARTS (diversified tactic CAlibration and bias-Resistant Tree Search), which balances tactic diversity and importance while calibrating model confidence. CARTS also introduces preference modeling and an adjustment term related to the ratio of valid tactics to improve the bias-resistance of the value function.

## Getting Started
TODO
1. Get data
python scripts/trace.py 
2. run CARTS
sh run.sh
